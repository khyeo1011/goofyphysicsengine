# Goofy Physics Engine

A simple 2D physics engine written in C++ for educational and experimental purposes. The project demonstrates basic physics simulation concepts and rendering using OpenGL and GLFW.

## Features
- 2D rigid body simulation
- Rectangle objects and collision
- OpenGL rendering
- Minimal dependencies (GLFW, GLAD, stb, Nuklear)

## Project Structure
- src — All source files excluding dependencies
- 2d — Core 2D physics engine source files
- util — Utility functions
- include — External headers (GLAD, stb, Nuklear, etc.)
- deps — Third-party dependencies
- bin — Compiled binaries and shaders
- build — Build output (generated by CMake)

## Building

This project uses CMake for cross-platform builds and easy maintainance on dependencies (e.g. GLFW).

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.10+
- C++ compiler (MSVC, GCC, or Clang)
- OpenGL development libraries

### Build Steps (Windows)
1. Open a terminal in the project root directory.
2. Run:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```
3. Binaries will be generated in the bin directory.

## Running
- Run goofyphysicsengine2d.exe for the main 2D physics demo.
- Save shaders following the template in bin/shaders directory
